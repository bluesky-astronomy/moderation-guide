**Welcome to the Astronomy on Bluesky moderation team! ðŸŽ‰**

This guide is your starting point for getting up to speed with the project. It provides all the resources, tools, and information you need to help with moderating the feeds.

## What moderators do

Moderators of the Astronomy feeds have three core roles:

1. Process signups of new users to the feeds.
2. Ensure that content posted to the feeds is appropriate and follows [the feed rules](https://github.com/bluesky-astronomy/rules).
3. Help to build a strong, inclusive community of astronomers and astronomy enthusiasts on Bluesky.

These three roles are explained below.

### Handling signups

We currently get multiple new signups to the feeds per day. Most of the signup process is automated by [the Astrobot](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hol3fzmh4guugasdolbpzwtk), but we still require a final human verification step to ensure that any candidate new posters will adhere to [the feed rules](https://github.com/bluesky-astronomy/rules).

After asking users to agree to the feed rules and explain why they'd like to sign up, the bot places new signups in the [signup feed](https://bsky.app/profile/emily.space/feed/signup). We recommend **pinning this feed to your home page in the app** so that you can keep an eye on it. The bot will also notify us (eventually) if there are outstanding signups.

To validate a signup, you should check the following things:

1. **That the user meets the description to join the feeds (Rule 1).** We also allow organisations relevant to the Astronomy community to join (such as journals).
2. **That the user does not look likely to break feed content rules.** People who already have a history of content scraping or posting AI images are generally not allowed to join without making a strict promise to _not_ do that in the future.
3. **That the user looks like a legitimate account in general.** Bot accounts frequently try to sign up! You can check the user's past post history to see if they look legit.

In general, we usually ask for more information from accounts signing up that have few/no prior posts and/or limited/no information in their profile.

This can then proceed one of two ways:

1. The signup is **validated** by a moderator 'liking' the most recent post by the astrobot in the relevant signup thread (such as [this one](https://bsky.app/profile/bot.astronomy.blue/post/3lbwtr72d7d2p)).
2. The signup is **cancelled** by a moderator replying to the most recent astrobot post with a post starting with 'cancel' (such as [in this example](https://bsky.app/profile/emily.space/post/3lbvzpeilec23)).
